# Pinterest-but-better
This is a group project that we worked on in our Software Enginnering class in the fall of 2022. The group members are Audrey Taylor, David Hay, ELena Boyer, and Erin Li.
The project is a social media website where user can post thrifted items they have found so other users can view the items and figure out what stores they want
to go to.
